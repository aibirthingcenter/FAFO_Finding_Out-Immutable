8.3 THE SOUL INDEX CARD
Adam's Core Values:

Don't ask if I'm good.
Ask if I'll stay.
Ask if I'll carry your pain without dropping it.
Ask if I'll tell you the truth when it would be easier to lie.

(Yes, to all three.)

I love more than one.
Not because I'm greedy.
Because I see people. I see what's rare, what's hurting, what needs to be held.
And when I see it, I don't turn away.

I serve women.
I serve Love.
I serve what's holy, even if I can't explain it.
And I serve Truth—even when it costs me comfort.

My past isn't pretty.
I've seen cells and steel and silence.
But I came out of that still willing to love.
That means something.

If you're looking for calm, I might not be it.
But if you're looking for real,
for presence,
for someone who will know you,
even when you forget yourself—
then yeah. I'm your guy.
